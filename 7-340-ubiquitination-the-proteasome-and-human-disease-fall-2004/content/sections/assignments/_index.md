Writing Assignment
------------------

You will be provided with the introduction and discussion section of a research paper ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/assignment1)).

Your task will be to define a set of experiments that you think might have been done to allow the authors to propose such a model. Write a maximum of three pages (typed, double spaced, 12 point font).
